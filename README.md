## 🎮 AlgoVerse — Web3 Gaming Platform

AlgoVerse is a decentralized gaming platform built on the Algorand blockchain.
It brings together multiple blockchain-based games where players can play, earn, and truly own their in-game assets through secure smart contracts and wallet integration.

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional gaming platforms often lack transparency and true ownership. AlgoVerse changes that by using Algorand’s high-speed, low-fee blockchain to deliver a new kind of gaming experience:

Players can earn rewards for participation.

All in-game assets are NFT-based and owned by the player.

Transactions are secure, transparent, and verifiable on-chain.
